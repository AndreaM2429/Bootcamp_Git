I'm new in this work space so, I would like to have a lot of share but it isn't the case.

- **First**: I have been working on my self-develop and is my first time to use Git.
- **Then**: I worked in diferent programs before such as apps web and no less important shool projets like a management clinic system.

That is all for now, I will continue update this.
